## Introduction
Within the MAE-4300 course, this project investigated ethical shortcomings in the development of Boeing’s 737 MAX, concentrating on the MCAS system and documented through weekly worksheets and formatted into an essay at the end. The assessment highlighted major concerns such as the underrepresentation of MCAS functionality, its absence from official documentation, and decisions driven by market competition rather than safety. Detailed analyses grounded in factual evidence, underlying assumptions, and ASME ethical standards exposed tensions between engineers’ duty to protect the public and organizational priorities.

## Idenitfying Ethical Issues
1. Should they have downplayed the importance of MCAS to the team and public?
2. Why did they not take accountability of original crash responsibilities?
3. Should they have had no training even after the 1st crash?
4. Should they have sped through the new design process?
5. Should Boeing have been in charge of its own safety certification and not FAA?
6. Should cost have been prioritized over safety testing?
7. Should they have left out MCAS from plane documentation?
8. Did the engineers have the right engineering expertise?
9. Should they have used software to solve aerodynamic issues?
10. Should they have let market competition dictate the design process and timelines?

## Ethical Analysis Write-Up
The Boeing 737 MAX crisis stands as a defining example of ethical collapse in modern engineering. This tragedy emerged not from a single mistake but from a constellation of technical failures, organizational pressures, regulatory shortcomings, and compromised professional judgment. In depth analysis of the case studied in our Communications course over a course of four weeks, reveals how engineers, managers, and regulators repeatedly deviated from foundational ethical principles, ultimately contributing to preventable loss of life. The ethical dimensions of this case underscore the importance of transparency, accountability, and professional integrity within systems where public safety is of greatest importance.

At the center of the crisis was the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS. This system relied on data from a single angle‑of‑attack sensor, creating a severe vulnerability within a flight‑critical control mechanism. When this lone sensor provided incorrect data, MCAS repeatedly pushed the aircraft’s nose downward, yet pilots had not been informed of the system’s existence and had not received sufficient training to respond in emergency situations. Documentation had failed to include MCAS in which safety indicators were treated as optional add‑ons, and internal communication among engineers, test pilots, and management minimized the seriousness of repeated MCAS activations. These material failures placed crews and passengers in situations where catastrophic outcomes became nearly unavoidable.

The individual decisions made by Boeing personnel reflected deeper ethical tensions. Engineers chose to minimize pilot training costs while test pilots did not fully disclose aggressive MCAS behavior during simulations, and executives prioritized creating continuity with earlier 737 models to ensure rapid market acceptance. Whistleblowers who attempted to raise concerns were ignored or marginalized. When viewed through the lens of professional ethics, these actions represented deviations from core engineering principles, including the obligation to protect public safety, to communicate honestly, and to provide accurate technical information. Instead of elevating safety concerns, individuals repeatedly acted to preserve corporate interests. These failures were compounded by Boeing's decision to downplay MCAS’s importance publicly, a choice that reflected a misalignment between ethical duty and organizational loyalty.

The broader organizational context exacerbated these individual shortcomings. Boeing’s internal culture emphasized speed, cost reduction, and maintaining market competitiveness, particularly against rival manufacturer Airbus. Management incentives were tied to rapid certification and delivery milestones, reinforcing behaviors that prioritized commercial outcomes over safety considerations. Communication within the organization became siloed, preventing engineers working on documentation or subsystem testing from having access to full information about MCAS’s risks. Simultaneously, the structure of the FAA’s delegated authority system allowed Boeing to oversee critical portions of its own certification. This arrangement blurred regulatory oversight and created opportunities for conflicts of interest, leaving engineers uncertain about where ultimate safety responsibility resided.

Different interpretations of key ethical concepts further obscured Boeing’s decision‑making. Safety, for example, was understood by Boeing largely in terms of regulatory compliance, while victims’ families viewed safety as the absolute protection of human life. Such narrow definitions allowed systemic issues to be portrayed as isolated anomalies rather than evidence of deeper structural failures. Responsibility was similarly diluted, as Boeing attributed early incidents to pilot error rather than acknowledging design flaws and documentation omissions. These differing definitions contributed to delays in corrective action and hindered institutional learning following the first crash.

Week 9’s examination of practical constraints helps explain, though not excuse, why engineers may have struggled to act ethically. Organizational pressure discouraged full disclosure of safety risks, and employees feared retaliation or career consequences if they contradicted official company narratives. Limited access to complete technical information hindered engineers’ ability to recognize the full scope of MCAS’s flaws. Cultural norms emphasizing hierarchy and conformity further prevented dissent, making it difficult for ethical concerns to influence decision‑making. Many engineers simply did not possess the authority to challenge accelerated deadlines or resist decisions that compromised safety.

Despite these constraints, engineering ethics requires that public safety supersede all other considerations. In this case, fundamental principles were subordinated to commercial imperatives. The tragedy exposes the consequences of failing to uphold Canon 1, which places the safety, health, and welfare of the public above all else. It also highlights the dangers of treating compliance as a procedural checklist rather than a commitment to responsible engineering practice.

Addressing the failures evident in the Boeing case requires reforms at multiple levels. Individual engineers must be equipped with training that strengthens ethical decision‑making, transparent communication, and recognition of conflicts of interest. Organizational structures must support an environment in which dissent is protected rather than suppressed, and where safety concerns carry authority equal to commercial goals. Independent oversight mechanisms must replace self‑certification practices that introduce conflicts of interest into safety‑critical decisions. At a systemic level, regulatory frameworks must evolve to ensure that commercial pressure does not undermine public welfare, including by removing or limiting industry self‑regulation and enhancing global coordination among certification authorities.

The Boeing 737 MAX case demonstrates that engineering is fundamentally a moral profession. Engineers hold responsibilities that directly impact the lives of the public, and the failure to prioritize safety can have catastrophic consequences. The events surrounding MCAS reveal the dangers of allowing organizational culture, economic pressures, and regulatory ambiguity to supersede ethical obligations. Restoring trust in aviation requires not only technical corrections but also a renewed commitment to ethical principles at every level of the engineering process. The lessons drawn from this case should shape future practices, reminding engineers and organizations alike that ethical integrity is not optional but essential to safeguarding human life.
